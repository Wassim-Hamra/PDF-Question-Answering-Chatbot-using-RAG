# DocuBot: PDF Question-Answering Chatbot using RAG

DocuBot is a PDF-based Question-Answering (QA) chatbot built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. This chatbot allows users to upload PDF documents and interact with them to retrieve answers to their questions based on the content of the documents. It uses **LangChain** and **HuggingFace** models to process the documents and provide relevant answers.

## Features

- **Upload multiple PDF files**: Users can upload multiple PDF files to interact with.
- **Document Embedding**: Once documents are uploaded, they are embedded into a vector space for efficient searching.
- **Question-Answering**: Ask questions related to the provided documents, and DocuBot will return the most relevant answers.
- **Document Similarity Search**: Explore documents related to the question for more context.

## Project Structure

### 1. **`Load PDFs`**: 
   - Takes the uploaded PDFs and extracts text from them.
   - Returns the documents in a format that can be processed by the model.

### 2. **`Vector Embedding`**:
   - Embeds the documents into vectors using **HuggingFace Embeddings** and stores them in a **FAISS** vector store.
### 2. **`LLM`**:
   - Used Groq to access the **gemma2-9b-it** model.
### 4. **`Interface`**:
   - User interacts with the chatbot via a simple text input field.
   - Once the documents are embedded, the user can ask questions and receive answers based on the context of the uploaded documents.
### 4. **`Deployment`**:
   - Used Streamlit Cloud for deployment
